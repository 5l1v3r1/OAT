This package will contain wrappers for aerodynamics forces on generic bodies. In future one can implement detailed aerodynamical interactions by extended new classes from the interface given here. 

There will be some useful tools to import experimental data as c++ and matlab functions to create various type of complicated aerodynamical behaviours.
